Introduction
This project employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict time series data from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India, spanning the period from August 30, 2016, to December 22, 2024. The primary focus was on preprocessing the data, designing and training the LSTM model, and assessing its performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

Data Processing
The dataset comprises daily stock indicators, including Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and % Change. Key preprocessing steps included:
	Converting volume values with suffixes (e.g., 'M', 'B') into numeric format.
	Interpolating missing data using a linear method.
	Scaling features with MinMaxScaler for better compatibility with the LSTM model.
A sliding window approach was used to generate input-output sequences for training.

Model Architecture
The LSTM model architecture was designed as follows:
	Input Layer: Processes sequences of normalized features.
	LSTM Layer: Contains 50 units with ReLU activation.
	Dense Layer: Outputs single-step forecasts.
	Optimization and Training Details: 
	Loss Function: Mean Squared Error.
	Optimizer: Adamax.
	Training Parameters: 100 epochs with a batch size of 1.
This architecture was selected to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy.
